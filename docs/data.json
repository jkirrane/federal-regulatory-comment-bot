      "abstract": "The FAA is adopting a new airworthiness directive (AD) for certain Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG (RRD) Model Trent 1000-A, Trent 1000-AE, Trent 1000-C, Trent 1000-CE, Trent 1000-D, Trent 1000-E, Trent 1000-G, and Trent 1000-H engines. This AD was prompted by a determination made by the manufacturer that a high-pressure compressor (HPC) mini-disc anti-rotation block could possibly release into the HPC assembly stage 5 and 6 discs and the cone rotor rear shaft (HPC rear drum) during an engine operation. This AD requires repetitive borescope inspections (BSIs) of the HPC rear drum cavity and cavities between each HPC rotor disc, and depending on the results of inspection, removal of the engine from service. This AD also allows an alternative method of complying with the repetitive BSIs if certain actions are accomplished. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

      "abstract": "In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, FAA invites public comments about our intention to request the approval of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for a new information collection. The Federal Register Notice with a 60-day comment period soliciting comments on the following collection of information was published on June 10, 2025. The collection involves a short online survey gathering information on medical disclosure behaviors of working pilots. The information to be collected will be used to update the current safety risk assessments for integration into the Aviation Safety (AVS), Office of Aviation Medicine (AAM) Safety Risk Management process. The FAA received one comment during the 60-day comment period on the Federal Register. The FAA sincerely thank the Air Line Pilots Association, International (ALPA) for their letter of support and further recommendations for our data collection and study. In the letter, ALPA shared concerns regarding the anonymity of the source, voluntary informed participation, aggregate-only reporting, and response evaluations, which the FAA has recently addressed. We also appreciate ALPA for bringing their concerns of independent oversight and legal data protection to our attention. We will work closely with ALPA representatives to integrate these recommendations throughout our study design. Again, we sincerely thank ALPA for the letter of support and recommendations on the proposed collection of information.",

Since 2013, HUD has issued three final rules for determining whether a given practice has an unjustified discriminatory effect under the Fair Housing Act, even where practices were not motivated by discriminatory intent. These rules formalized legal tests that were not explicit in statute and imposed a presumption of unlawful discrimination when any variance in outcomes exists among protected classes, even without a showing of a facially discriminatory policy or discriminatory intent. Through this rulemaking, HUD is proposing to remove its discriminatory effects regulations and leaving to courts questions related to interpretations of disparate impact liability under the Fair Housing Act.",

      "abstract": "The FAA is superseding Airworthiness Directive (AD) 2025-23- 52, which applied to all Airbus Helicopters Model EC130B4 and EC130T2 helicopters. AD 2025-23-52, required replacing the center shaft assembly with a serviceable center shaft assembly (either a shaft with another part number (P/N) or the same P/N with lower hours time-in- service (TIS)) and prohibited installing a center shaft assembly that is not a serviceable center shaft assembly on any helicopter. Since the FAA issued AD 2025-23-52, it was determined that for certain center shaft assemblies a repetitive inspection is adequate instead of replacement. This AD requires repetitively inspecting the center shaft assembly for cracks and replacing the center shaft assembly if it fails the inspection or exceeds a certain TIS. This AD also prohibits installing a center shaft assembly that is not a serviceable center shaft assembly on any helicopter. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.",

The FAA is proposing these actions to accommodate a U.S. Navy request to change the Fort Worth NAS JRB (Carswell Field) Class D airspace from full-time to part-time and establish part-time Class E surface airspace; the associated airspace reviews conducted to accommodate this request; and a biennial airspace review of the Perot Field/Fort Worth Alliance Airport, Fort Worth, TX.

      "abstract": "PHMSA is updating its regulations to allow operators to apply modern risk management principles in addressing the safety of gas pipelines affected by class location changes. Relying on an approach originally developed in the 1950s, PHMSA's regulations use class locations to provide an additional margin of safety in the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of gas pipelines based on population density. When the class location of a pipeline changes due to an increase in population density, an operator may need to take certain actions to confirm or to revise the maximum allowable operating pressure of a segment. Because the methods traditionally used for that purpose do not account for modern risk management principles, PHMSA has granted special permits for more than two decades allowing operators to use an integrity-management-based alternative. This final rule adopts that `IM alternative' by regulation to provide operators with an additional method for confirming or restoring the maximum allowable operating pressure of certain eligible segments that experience class location changes.",

While the regulation was intended to summarize the Fair Housing Act (FHA) prohibitions on discrimination related to real estate related loans, appraisals, and advertising, the Board's last substantive amendment to the regulation was finalized in 2001. Thus, the regulation may not reflect all case law or regulatory developments under the FHA, a statute that primarily falls under the jurisdiction of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and continues to apply to federal credit unions (FCUs) regardless of the NCUA's regulations. Thus, the Board believes the current regulation may cause confusion and unnecessary burden because it has not kept up with changes in FHA interpretation and implementation. For these reasons, the Board is proposing to remove this regulation in its entirety.",
